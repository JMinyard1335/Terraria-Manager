 # Terraria Manager
This is a hobby project and something I started to help streamline when I needed to work on any of the servers. It is a collection of tools to help manage and automate running multiple terraria server instances on a single machine. There are many tools this manager uses to make like easier a list of these tools are provided below:

- install: install the Terraria server from the official site.
- uninstall: uninstall the Terraria server
- remove: uninstall the TManager tool chain
- launch: start a Terraria Server session
- stop: halt a Terraria Server session
- view: open a running Terraria Server session
- update: update the server from the official source
- backup: backup A Terraria Resource (Server, World, Config)
- configure: change a config file setting.

This program is built off a configuration file that tells the program where to place certain things. Info on the config file can be found [here]().
Installation Locations for the server, World storage location, and other settings can be found in the configuration file. 

## Installation
Currently the only installation process available is git and the only tested system is pop-os and debian based distributions.

### Git
To install the TManger on to your desired machine simply log into that machine and run the following commands in the terminal

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JMinyard1335/Terraria-Manager.git
cd Terraria-Manager
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```


## Manager Config
This program uses a configuration file to allow some flexibility as to how you want to lay out your server and files. Simply modify the desired variables inside the provided config file located at:

``` bash
$HOME/.config/terraria-manager/terraria-manager.cfg
```

### TERRARIA_DIR
This is the root path for all other paths. Useful if like me you keep all of your terraria server info in a single place like 'tserver'. When this variable is set all other paths are relative to this path.

```bash
$TERRARIA_DIR/$TERRARIA_SERVER_DIR/$TERRARIA_SERVER
```
would become the path to the server executable

### TERRARIA_SERVER
The Terraria Server executable that will be run by the Manager. 

### TERRARIA_SERVER_DIR
This is the path where the manager will look to install and uninstall the server on your system.

### TERRARIA_WORLD_DIR
This is the path the manager will look in to find world save files for games.

### TERRARIA_CONFIG_DIR
This is the path that the manager will look for server config files at. These are configs for the Terraria Server not the TManager config itself.

### TERRARIA_BACKUP_DIR
This is where the manager will store backups of resources created by the backup command. Each resource will have its own sub directory i.e. Worlds will be '$TERRARIA_BACKUP_DIR/worlds'.



## API
These are the basic commands that can be given to the manager.
``` shell
TManager new
TManager launch	<config>		# Launch a server based on the config file.
TManager stop	<config>		# Stop the server running the given config.
TManager view	<config>		# View the server running the given config.
TManager update					# Update the server to the newest version.
TManager backup [options]		# Creates backups of the worlds and config files.
```
